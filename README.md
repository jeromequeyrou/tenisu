## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **Tenisu** application, a NestJS app developed to manage and display information about tennis players. This project exposes REST endpoints to retrieve and analyze data about players.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version >= 14.x)
- npm (or Yarn)
- Nest CLI (optional but recommended)

You can install the Nest CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeromequeyrou/tenisu.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tenisu
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Useful Commands

- **Start the server in development mode**:
  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
  ```

- **Build the project for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Run the application from the build**:
  Once the project is compiled with the `npm run build` command, you can start the application from the generated files in the `dist` directory by using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  This command runs the application in production mode from the build. Ensure you have compiled the project before running this.

- **Run unit tests**:
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Run unit tests in watch mode**:
  ```bash
  npm run test:watch
  ```

- **Lint the code**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Format the code**:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

## Usage

### API Examples

The application exposes several REST endpoints through controllers. Here are some example API requests:
